# [Neighborhood in Toronto](https://rawnote.dinhanhthi.com/files/ibm/neighborhoods_in_toronto)

Segmenting and Clustering Neighbourhoods in Toronto
The project includes scraping the Wikipedia page for the postal codes of Canada and then process and clean the data for the clustering. The clustering is carried out by K Means and the clusters are plotted using the Folium Library. The Boroughs containing the name 'Toronto' in it are first plotted and then clustered and plotted again.

All the 3 tasks of web scraping, cleaning and clustering are implemented in the same notebook for the ease of evaluation.
